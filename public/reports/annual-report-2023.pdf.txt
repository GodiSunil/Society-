DEVELOPMENT SOCIETY FOR POOR
ANNUAL REPORT 2022-2023

PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS

I. EDUCATIONAL, VOCATIONAL SKILL TRAINING AND OTHER PROJECTS

a. Educational Programs:

A total number of 1920 children benefit from our educational scholarship support. The children who are orphans, semi-orphan and poorest of the poor. Some have guardians, who are agricultural coolies on daily wages and other care takers are ailing and unable to do any physical labour. The children are selected on the basis of being orphans, semi orphans, from socially marginalised communities and the poorest.

Under this children's program there are two categories of support, they are:

i. Educational Assistance Program: Under the Educational Assistance Programme 885 children were supplied with note books, two pairs of school uniforms, school bag and shoes.

ii. Educational Sponsorship Program: To open up educational opportunities for these unfortunate children, educational sponsorship program, to impart quality education to children, from these vulnerable group, have been planned. Under this sponsorship program, 1,035 children are assisted through school tuition fees, note books, two pairs of school uniforms, school bags and shoes.

All these children are from the socially backward communities, whose parents are farm coolies economically marginalized and unable to educate their children. The children are taken to child labor losing their chances of education and the joys of childhood. Our educational support is a boon for these children as they get an opportunity to join school and better their lives. The children are regular to their classes, show great enthusiasm to study and excel. We are encouraged as our efforts are bearing ample fruit.

Our coordinators regularly monitor these programs by visiting the school, checking up the progress reports interacting with the head masters and teachers to know the progress made by the children. They also take time to meet the parents of the children advising them to encourage their children in their studies.

b. Mineral Water Plants for the School children and for the Public:

Clean drinking water is elixir of life and crucial indicator towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDF). It is essential for the sustenance of human, animal and vegetative life on earth. Guntur district is reeling under severe gap of water demand and supply. The drinking water in the district is hit by fluorosis.

The Mineral Water plant with "Reverse Osmosis" technology has been set up for the school students located in Macherla region to address the drinking water problem of the School.

Another Mineral Water Plant with Reverse Osmosis Technology is established in the Rentachintala village, Guntur, India which is benefiting 1000 families in the village. With the implementation of the project the village people are provided with clean drinking water that promotes good health and hygiene among the lower sections of the community.

c. Computer Training Center in the Schools at Macherla:

Computers have invaded all spheres of life, right from our homes, offices, corporate houses, educational and research institutions, hospitals, air, road and rail transport, industrial units, space technology, etc. Computers have become very relevant in the present day society. There is a great demand for trained and skilled personnel in computer operation due to the ever-growing usage and wider applications of computers in all fields of activity. In these circumstances, computer training centre installed in the target school is helping 900 students from socially and economically marginalized communities to get trained in computer applications that would assure them a good and bright future.

900 pupils from the school have access to computer learning and being trained in computer operations. The students are efficiently operating the computer and acquainted themselves with its various applications and become computer savvy. Students overall academic performance improved and teaching competence of the teachers gained proficiency. The students gain abundant knowledge on computers for career growth.

d. Digital Class Rooms:

The Digital classroom is a "Technology-enabled" learning environment where Student learning and Interaction with the Teacher. Digital education enhances the learning experience of students by better engaging their attention and enabling them to grasp concepts more readily. It has changed the way education is imparted – a single query or doubt can be clarified in seconds online, there are innumerable resources available for a child online that add on to the classroom teachings. But it's a different story altogether in the rural interior. Dismal condition of the schools, skewed teacher-student ratio, lack of proper study materials; digital education in such a condition seems a far-off dream. To make the dream of the rural students a reality, "Digital Class Rooms" were established in 2 Schools of Palandau Region. These smart class rooms improved academic performance of the students and the teaching effectiveness of the teachers alike. This has brought about complete transformation in the classrooms.
