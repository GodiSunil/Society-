                <h2>I) EDUCATIONAL, VOCATIONAL SKILL TRAINING AND OTHER PROJECTS</h2>
                
                <h3>a. Educational Programs:</h3>
                <p>A total number of 1300 children benefit from our educational scholarship support. The children who are orphans, semi-orphan and poorest of the poor. Some have guardians, who are agricultural coolies on daily wages and other care takers are ailing and unable to do any physical labour. The children are selected on the basis of being orphans, semi orphans, from socially marginalised communities and the poorest.</p>
                
                <h4>Under this children's program there are three categories of support:</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Educational Assistance Program:</strong> Under the Educational Assistance Programme 370 children were supplied with note books, two pairs of school uniforms, school bag and shoes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Educational Sponsorship Program:</strong> To open up educational opportunities for these unfortunate children, educational sponsorship program, to impart quality education to children, from these vulnerable groups, have been planned. Under this sponsorship program, 930 children are assisted through school tuition fees, note books, two pairs of school uniforms, school bags and shoes.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>All these children are from the socially backward communities, whose parents are farm coolies economically marginalized and unable to educate their children. The children are taken to child labor losing their chances of education and the joys of childhood. Our educational support is a boon for these children as they get an opportunity to join school and better their lives. The children are regular to their classes, show great enthusiasm to study and excel. We are encouraged as our efforts are bearing ample fruit.</p>
                <p>Our coordinators regularly monitor these programs by visiting the school, checking up the progress reports interacting with the head masters and teachers to know the progress made by the children.
